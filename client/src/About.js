            <h2>About Dots and Boxes: </h2> <br/><br/>

            <p > In the 19th century, the game “la pipopipette” was first published by one Francois Edouard Anatole Lucas,<br/>
            a French mathematician known
            for his studies on the Fibonacci sequence.With a pencil and paper, you may have enjoyed this pastime
            if you have played Game of Dots, Pigs in a Pen, Dot to Dot Grid, or Boxes.From Bolivia to Scandinavia and many places in between, the game of Dots and Boxes, as we call our version, is played my people of all ages with many variations and having many names.In Bolivia it is is played on an Inca Cross grid, a“ Chakana”,
            adding more complexity to the game.In its“ dual graph” form“ Strings and Coins” it is played on a grid of coins at the vertices with strings
            for the lines which form the boxes: the winner is the player with the most coins at the end of the game.On to Poland where the local style of game play is called Kropki,
            here a player can claim a section of many squares on the board upon completion of it’ s boundary.Our Dots and Boxes friends in the Netherlands refer to the game as“ kamertje verhuren” which translates to Rent - a - Room.Depending on how the game is begun, with or without some or all of the outer lines already determined, the board may be a Swedish board, an American board, or an Icelandic board.Other names
            for this game or its variants are Boxit, Game of Dots and Squares, Stake Your Claim, Squaresville,
            The Game of Squares, Bygge Lejligheder, Dot To Dot, Dotso, KARREE, Käsekästchen, Kästchenziehen,
            Les Petits Carrés, Τελίτσες, Honeycomb(using a hexagonal grid) and many more.<br/><br/></p>

            <p>At first glance this game may seem a simple children game, but upon further inspection one finds that analysis is complicated considerably due to the fact that unlike most impartial games in which the last player to move wins, this game lacks such a normal play convention.Having many levels of
            strategic complexity, it is no easy task to create an artificially intelligent algorithm to allow
            for man versus machine gameplay.This fine game is studied in game theoretical courses at many universities.Those who wish to delve deeper into the game may enjoy Elwyn Berlekamp’ s book“ The Game of Dots and Boxes - Sophisticated Child’ s Play”, published by A K Peters Ltd, 2000.<br/><br/>
